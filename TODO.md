- **Title:** Research Off-the-Shelf DuckDB Migration Tool
- **Priority:** P2
- **Effort:** Small
- **Trigger:** Discussion during MVP planning for the auditable ledger revealed the risk of maintaining a custom migration script.
- **Why defer:** The custom script is sufficient for the MVP, and building the core feature is the current priority.
- **Proposed next step:** Dedicate a short timebox to survey the ecosystem for existing Python-based DuckDB migration tools.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A decision document or update to `ARCHITECTURE.md` recommending a tool or confirming that a custom script remains the best option.

- **Title:** Enable Playwright Browsers Under Nix Sandbox
- **Priority:** P1
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Trigger:** 2025-11-11 attempt to run `direnv exec . playwright install` failed because the packaged driver could not run dynamically linked binaries in the current sandbox, blocking automated SPA tests.
- **Why defer:** User requested that we land the backend + SPA first and address Playwright setup in a follow-up commit.
- **Proposed next step:** Investigate Nix-friendly Playwright packaging (e.g., nixpkgs `playwright-driver` wrappers or containerized runners), document env vars, and confirm `direnv exec . playwright test` passes.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Repeatable install/run instructions captured in README, CI script invoking Playwright succeeds locally, and docs updated to remove the temporary limitation.
