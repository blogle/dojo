- **Title:** Research Off-the-Shelf DuckDB Migration Tool
- **Priority:** P2
- **Effort:** Small
- **Trigger:** Discussion during MVP planning for the auditable ledger revealed the risk of maintaining a custom migration script.
- **Why defer:** The custom script is sufficient for the MVP, and building the core feature is the current priority.
- **Proposed next step:** Dedicate a short timebox to survey the ecosystem for existing Python-based DuckDB migration tools.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A decision document or update to `ARCHITECTURE.md` recommending a tool or confirming that a custom script remains the best option.
