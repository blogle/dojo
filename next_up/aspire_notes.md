This document is meant to review the Aspire Budget spreadsheet pages and detail what we like/dislike.

Legend -
A: Amanda
B: Brandon

Dashboard:
- A: I like that it has all accounts with their balances.
- A: I like that there is a table with all of the budget categories and their amounts (goal amount, budgeted, activity, available)
- A: We dont care about the goal/percentage icons.
- A: We dont use the budget progress bar
- A: I like that it displays our networth and chart of its growth over time (including hoverover, though I wish it displayed date and percent MoM)
- A: I like that we can see the breakdown of our networth accounts - but not necessary to show on the dashboard.
- A: I want a validation feature that ensures that the amount budgeted is actually available across our budgeting accounts (aka in chase). 
 * Our current spreadsheet shows we have budget available of 118k but there is 128k actually in our chase account.


 Ideal Dashboard:
 - I want to see our burn rate over time.
 - 

Transactions:
- A: Like I can add filter to highlight categories

 Ideal Transactions:
 - I can select a category to highlight those rows, or hide all other
 - Autocomplete (fuzzy) for memo input
 - Reconcile tooling / diff
 - We need some visual indication of when you last reconciled. (A: I dont care about the date I just use the prior transaction anyway)

Allocations:
